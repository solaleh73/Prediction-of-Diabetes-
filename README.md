# Prediction-of-Diabetes-
The amount of data collected each day is enormous, and health care communities naturally produce large amounts of information on a daily basis. Although the field of health care is rich in information, it requires the discovery of hidden relationships and patterns in the data. On the other hand, data mining techniques support the medical decision to correctly diagnose and treat the disease and reduce the workload of specialists. This article is proposed a method for predicting diabetes using classification algorithms in data mining techniques. Therefore, popular classification algorithms including decision tree, support vector machine, Naive Bayes and also the K-nearest neighbor are investigated to predict diabetes. Also, in this paper, a method using stacking algorithm is presented for PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset in four combinations of mentioned classification methods. The results show that the second combination of this stacking model (Stacking 2 model) has 75.43% accuracy, 58.38% specificity and 84.63% sensitivity, which in comparison with other combinations of stacking method as well as the decision tree classification algorithms, the Naive Bayes classification and the K-nearest neighbor classification are more accurate.
